# Early-Detection-of-Breast-Cancer
A machine learning project for detecting breast cancer using Python, data preprocessing, and model evaluation techniques. Implements algorithms to classify tumor types, analyzes datasets, and presents results with accuracy metrics for improved medical diagnosis support.

# Detecting Breast Cancer

# Overview
This project demonstrates a **machine learning workflow**to detect breast cancer using Python. 
It covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and result 
interpretation to support early diagnosis and better medical decision-making.

# Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature selection and scaling
- Machine learning model training (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Clear visualizations for analysis

#  Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy,Pandas       – Data manipulation
- Scikit-learn       – Machine learning models
- Matplotlib,Seaborn – Data visualization

# Project Structure
- Detecting_Breast_Cancer.ipynb  # Main notebook with all code and outputs
- README.md                      # Project description
